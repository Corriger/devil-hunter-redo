        </ul>
        <strong>Appearance</strong>
        <p>Dante stands in at around 6’6” and weighs in at 216 lbs, with a physique equivalent to that of an Olympic gymnast at their prime. He possesses hair as white as pristine snow that extends to just past his chin, bangs parted from his right eye -said
        orbs are a piercing ice blue that combine with his generally blank-to-irritated expression to give off the obvious air and demeanor of a man that has seen enough and will tolerate nothing further. He sports a square jaw, strong and somewhat pronounced,
        and a narrow forehead. His body is immaculate, the reformation of his body removing any and all irregularities he used to possess - as a result, he doesn’t appear to be any older than his mid- to late-30s. His skin tone has gotten darker since his
        ‘ascension’, taking on a pigmentation closer to an orange hue that amazingly hides otherwise visible veins and the like. His body is so perfectly formed that it loops back around and gives away his inherently unnatural heritage.</p>

        <p>His attire, while it is changed to suit his current serious outlook, still wears the trademark crimson that allows him to keep the name ‘Redgrave’ even after all this time; Dante has one set of attire he wears both out in public and in the confines of
        his office, so much so that one would not be faulted for thinking it was his <span>only</span> clothing. His coat has changed to that of a deeper shade of red that serves as a contrast to his unnaturally striking eyes, with the front torso
        area outright different from the rest: it is made of a flexible dark leather that connects to the buckled black collar of his top. He wears it zipped up to just below the collarbone, leaving the skin exposed from there. He also has a black leather
        strap wrapping around to his back over and under the right shoulder, with two golden studs in the front; this is likely where Dante’s sword is attached to. He wears denim-style pants the same shade of red as his jacket with a belt strapped securely
        to each thigh, likely connecting to the holsters hidden beneath the twin tails of his coat, and black riding boots. The pants are held up with a skull-buckled belt, the design on which seems to hover between that of a human cranium and a demonic
        head. On his hands he wears strapped leather gloves that completely encompass his fingers and even some of the arm up past the wrists.</p>
        <strong>Personality</strong>
        <p>Dante seems to have lost much of his cocky attitude and has become much more stoic, being far more serious about matters than he usually was. During the few times where he does interact with others he is very blunt and callous, calling things
          as he sees them and wasting little time with merely beating around the bush. His overly direct methodology is reflected even in the way he fights; he uses firearms even more than usual to simply execute his marks and get on with his unending life,
          only ever drawing Rebellion when something is a little too big to just gun down.</p>

        <p>Attitude and personality, however, are two different spectrums of the persona. As initially uncaring and mistrusting as he is, Dante still has a predisposition towards going after perpetrators as opposed to just everyone. If he ever finds that a mark
        is harmless both in present and future he will almost always ignore them and let them be on their way. It is not quite known if this is his inherent human kindness or merely him not wanting to deal with unnecessary annoyances, but nonetheless
        the ‘innocent’ are always spared. For those that happen to become his acquaintances he treats them with just a tad more respect and attention than strangers, but ultimately does not show or feel deeper attachment to them. He is a very stubborn
        individual; he makes a decision, nothing short of incredibly powerful mind-control can change that.</p>

        <p>He has a habit of flipping a coin when he is at a significant crossroads in a situation; this is his only remaining moral barrier keeping him from becoming like any other demon.</p>

      <article id="tab-3">
        <section>
          <p>Even in his youth Dante possessed strength beyond that of humans and most demons - now, with his advanced age, he is leagues beyond even his father in terms of power. At his weakest he can hold a large vehicle over his head indefinitely, and at his
            strongest he can overpower massive devils like the skyscraper-sized Nefasturris. The sheer amount of energy his body can both deliver and take means that he is one hell of a powerhouse, capable of performing Herculean feats without so much as a
            sweat or fear of injury or fatigue. He can survive for exceptionally long periods of time without food or supplies, and the lengths at which he has done so hint at his ability to last forever on what power his body contains alone. Dante is also
            capable of withstanding extreme levels of heat and subzero temperatures for a comparably long stretch of time, can leap tall buildings in a single bound, and is fast enough to dodge bullets shot at point-blank ranges.</p>
          <p>His unfathomable level of power is partly thanks to his greater still level of cellular regeneration, powered by his demonic heritage and accelerated to points where moderate wounds heal as soon as they are inflicted; he can function without missing a
            beat even if there were numerous energy-draining blades stabbed through him. This regenerative process is well layered, a passive portion of his nervous system detecting and mending what qualifies as superficial wounds in the grand scheme of his
            well being, keeping pain from affecting his trains of thought. He is nearly immune to toxic atmosphere, normal poisoning, diseases and even aging; physically, he is immortal to the point where he not only retains his age but also his physical state.</p>
          <p>His training, experience and natural affinities has rendered his mind a veritable fortress without much effort; he is mostly immune to attempts at mind control or subtle influences, as well as most illusory attempts. His perception is similarly uncanny, able to see the slightest of movements or disturbances in the air with the naked eye alone - with his demonic power, however, he can outright see apparitions or at the very least their lingering trails from before they passed to     their final resting place. He can sense just about anything with demonic presences from a considerable distance away, and upon focusing can sense even the absolute weakest of traces.</p>
          <p>Dante has such a plethora of combat experience that he splits his thought processes into various 'styles' that allow him to focus on only a single aspect of battle. This is hardly a drawback to him, as he can switch between them as easily as he can breathe.</p>

            <strong>Trickster</strong>
            <p>A combat style that allows Dante to dance, dash, and disappear all along the battleground as untouchable as a phantom. Counter-maneuvers are regulated effectively towards instinct, using his vast array of experience for the few moments where he isn’t prepared for something - though for the most part, this is hardly triggered. Dante’s mind is plenty complex enough to receive and interpret information from his senses near instantly, giving him plenty of time to react accordingly.</p>
            <p>With this style he can perform pseudo-teleports over short distances, granting him the advantage of getting the drop on an enemy even within the very midsts of intense close quarters combat, and in combination with the array of powers granted by utilizing the less stringent laws of physics granted by having a shadow copy he can dodge attacks entirely even if that same attack already hit him. In such an instance he simply shoves himself aside by near-instantaneously replacing his own being with that of shadow mass, the force that comes from such a replacement serving to propel him away from the direction of the attack.</p>
          </article>
          <article id="sub-tab-2">
            <strong>Gunslinger</strong>
            <p>Perhaps one of the only styles that maintains the original flair he used to possess. Gunslinger style allows him to turn simple aiming and shooting to a veritable circus act, throwing and flinging his weapons around in perfect gunkatas. Even with the constant movement of his weaponry he can still hit targets with precision accuracy - now he can just hit multiple targets at once even when surrounded.</p>
            <p>Though this is not the only advantage to this style; he also uses his demonic power to directly modify the very constitution of a weapon, reinforcing and reconfiguring his arsenal to points where it should be borderline physically impossible to do certain things: a prime example is him using a revolver and firing all six shots at once like a shotgun. This prevents him from using normal weapons anymore - however, he has a large enough catalog of custom-made weaponry to avoid that issue.</p>
          </article>

          <article id="sub-tab-3">
            <strong>Swordmaster</strong>
            <p>Dante is a master of the sword, swinging around claymores like they were daggers - Swordmaster, however, makes even professional fencers lose all sense of self-confidence and esteem. He is able to move like he has eyes in the back of his head, striking enemies from behind with the same effort used to swat at a fly before going right back into slicing and dicing with precision and accuracy without missing a beat. He also possesses something of a telekinetic heft on whatever weapon he uses, combining his command of power with actual telekinesis to call weapons to him even from great distances.</p>
            <p>He can channel his energy through Devil Arms to unlock more of their elemental affinities, bringing about an entirely new game to a fight to hit demons where it hurts more. His sense of control also reflects through the way he uses his weapons, throwing out elemental wrath in the same breaths as actually attacking.</p>
          </article>

          <article id="sub-tab-4">
            <strong>Royal Guard</strong>
            <p>Dante makes a conscious effort to let his energy exude centimeters from him before regulating the resulting barrier to a passive state - from then on, he is protected further from damage with his Royalguard style. The energy is somewhat meager in comparison to what he can output, but compensates by focusing all energy into the points of impact. However, once he focuses his attention on blocking any particular method of blocking he puts out even more energy to completely nullify anything that comes his way. The more punishment dealt to him in either case, the more that kinetic energy is stored within the barrier and the more punishment Dante can take.</p>
            <p>From that point he can either take that energy and expel it with massive amounts of force back towards his assailant, heavily weakining their own defenses, or use it to form an demon exoskeleton that, while it limits his movement, is nigh impregnable.</p>
          </article>

          <article id="sub-tab-5">
            <strong>Quicksilver</strong>
            <p>A style that actually requires a bit more effort on Dante’s end to utilize - but it is instantly made up for with the mere fact that it is a temporal alteration combat state. Quicksilver allows him to use the inherent ‘strangeness’ of his demonic heritage in tandem with his own vast power to create particles that emit time-slowing fields, before releasing it all at once either through a radial burst or a more focused flash-burst. Both slow the areas of effect to a crawl to the point where a high-caliber bullet moves about as fast as a snail, though the focus burst slows the adversary down further still.</p>
            <p>As a passive effect of even possessing this style, Dante is immune to to similar temporal powers even down to the point of paradoxes occuring. His body will change according to what occurs in his timeline to change it, but his constituent parts as well as his powers and abilities remain the same; Devil Trigger bypasses all this outright, allowing him to retain his original devil body regardless of paradoxes.</p>
          </article>

          <article id="sub-tab-6">
            <strong>Doppelganger</strong>
            <p>Dante has come a startlingly long way with this style, originally a mere supplement to his past skill now effectively his own personal knight. His thoughts are linked perfectly with the subordinate Doppelganger, which resides within a personal pocket of the demon realm linked to Dante and manifests through his shadow - as a result it obeys his every mental command as soon as it comes, whether it be through following his actions or attacking independent of his own physical actions to overwhelm an adversary. Its shadowy mass is a peculiarity: while it can strike every bit as hard as Dante himself, it has far less physical resilience - however, this is made up with through the fact that it is much more malleable, able to keep attacking at optimal speeds even when there are weapons lodged inside of it that would serve as a hindrance even to Dante.</p>
            <p>His shadow is not the limits of his ability to summon the doppelganger; if he was in complete darkness, he could summon multiples of the creatures to assist him.</p>
