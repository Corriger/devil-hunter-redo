                <strong>Appearance</strong>
                <p>Dante stands in at around 6’6” and weighs in at 216 lbs, with a physique equivalent to that of an Olympic gymnast at their prime. He possesses hair as white as pristine snow that extends to just past his chin, bangs parted from his right
                    eye -said orbs are a piercing ice blue that combine with his generally blank-to-irritated expression to give off the obvious air and demeanor of a man that has seen enough and will tolerate nothing further. He sports a square jaw,
                    strong and somewhat pronounced, and a narrow forehead. His body is immaculate, the reformation of his body removing any and all irregularities he used to possess - as a result, he doesn’t appear to be any older than his mid- to late-30s.
                    His skin tone has gotten darker since his ‘ascension’, taking on a pigmentation closer to an orange hue that amazingly hides otherwise visible veins and the like. His body is so perfectly formed that it loops back around and gives
                    away his unnatural heritage.</p>

                <p>His attire, while it is changed to suit his current serious outlook, still wears the trademark crimson that allows him to keep the name ‘Redgrave’ even after all this time; Dante has one set of attire he wears both out in public and in
                    the confines of his office, so much so that one would not be faulted for thinking it was his <span>only</span> clothing. His coat has changed to that of a deeper shade of red that serves as a contrast to his unnaturally striking eyes,
                    with the front torso area outright different from the rest: it is made of a flexible dark leather that connects to the buckled black collar of his top. He wears it zipped up to just below the collarbone, leaving the skin exposed from
                    there. He also has a black leather strap wrapping around to his back over and under the right shoulder, with two golden studs in the front; this is likely where Dante’s sword is attached to. He wears denim-style pants the same shade
                    of red as his jacket with a belt strapped securely to each thigh, likely connecting to the holsters hidden beneath the twin tails of his coat, and black riding boots. The pants are held up with a skull-buckled belt, the design on which
                    seems to hover between that of a human cranium and a demonic head. On his hands he wears strapped leather gloves that completely encompass his fingers and even some of the arm up past the wrists.</p>
                <strong>Personality</strong>
                <p>Dante seems to have lost much of his cocky attitude and has become much more stoic, being far more serious about matters than he usually was. During the few times where he does interact with others he is very blunt and callous, calling
                    things as he sees them and wasting little time with merely beating around the bush. His overly direct methodology is reflected even in the way he fights; he uses firearms even more than usual to simply execute his marks and get on
                    with his unending life, only ever drawing Rebellion when something is a little too big to just gun down.</p>

                <p>Attitude and personality, however, are two different spectrums of the persona. As initially uncaring and mistrusting as he is, Dante still has a predisposition towards going after perpetrators as opposed to just everyone. If he ever finds
                    that a mark is harmless both in present and future he will almost always ignore them and let them be on their way. It is not quite known if this is his inherent human kindness or merely him not wanting to deal with unnecessary annoyances,
                    but nonetheless the ‘innocent’ are always spared. For those that happen to become his acquaintances he treats them with just a tad more respect and attention than strangers, but ultimately does not show or feel deeper attachment to
                    them. He is a very stubborn individual; he makes a decision, nothing short of incredibly powerful mind-control can change that.</p>

                <p>He has a habit of flipping a coin when he is at a significant crossroads in a situation; this is his only remaining moral barrier keeping him from becoming like any other demon.</p>

                    <p>Even in his youth Dante possessed strength beyond that of humans and most demons - now, with his advanced age, he is leagues beyond even his father in terms of power. At his weakest he can hold a large vehicle over his head indefinitely,
                        and at his strongest he can overpower massive devils like the skyscraper-sized Nefasturris. The sheer amount of energy his body can both deliver and take means that he is one hell of a powerhouse, capable of performing Herculean
                        feats without so much as a sweat or fear of injury or fatigue. He can survive for exceptionally long periods of time without food or supplies, and the lengths at which he has done so hint at his ability to last forever on what
                        power his body contains alone. Dante is also capable of withstanding extreme levels of heat and subzero temperatures for a comparably long stretch of time, can leap tall buildings in a single bound, and is fast enough to dodge
                        bullets shot at point-blank ranges.</p>
                    <p>His unfathomable level of power is partly thanks to his greater still level of cellular regeneration, powered by his demonic heritage and accelerated to points where moderate wounds heal as soon as they are inflicted; he can function
                        without missing a beat even if there were numerous energy-draining blades stabbed through him. This regenerative process is well layered, a passive portion of his nervous system detecting and mending what qualifies as superficial
                        wounds in the grand scheme of his well being, keeping pain from affecting his trains of thought. He is nearly immune to toxic atmosphere, normal poisoning, diseases and even aging; physically, he is immortal to the point where
                        he not only retains his age but also his physical state.</p>
                    <p>His training, experience and natural affinities has rendered his mind a veritable fortress without much effort; he is mostly immune to attempts at mind control or subtle influences, as well as most illusory attempts. His perception
                        is similarly uncanny, able to see the slightest of movements or disturbances in the air with the naked eye alone - with his demonic power, however, he can outright see apparitions or at the very least their lingering trails from
                        before they passed to their final resting place. He can sense just about anything with demonic presences from a considerable distance away, and upon focusing can sense even the absolute weakest of traces.</p>
                    <p>Dante has such a plethora of combat experience that he splits his thought processes into various 'styles' that allow him to focus on a particular aspect of battle. This is hardly a drawback to him, as he can switch between them as
                        easily as he can breathe.</p>

                        <strong>Trickster</strong>
                        <p>A combat style that allows Dante to dance, dash, and disappear all along the battleground as untouchable as a phantom. Counter-maneuvers are regulated effectively towards instinct, using his wealth of experience for the few moments
                            where he isn’t prepared for something. Dante’s mind is plenty complex enough to receive and interpret information from his senses near instantly, giving him plenty of time to react accordingly.</p>
                        <p>With this style he can perform pseudo-teleports over short distances, granting him the advantage of getting the drop on an enemy even within the very midsts of intense close quarters combat, and in combination with the array of
                            powers granted by utilizing shadow powers he can dodge attacks entirely even if that same attack already hit him. In such an instance he simply shoves himself aside by replacing his own being with that of shadow mass, the force
                            that comes from such a replacement serving to propel him away from the danger and leave him unharmed.</p>

                    <article id="sub-tab-02">
                        <strong>Gunslinger</strong>
                        <p>Perhaps one of the only styles that maintains the original flair he used to possess. Gunslinger style allows him to turn simple aiming and shooting to a veritable circus act, throwing and flinging his weapons around in perfect
                            gunkatas. Even with the constant movement of his weaponry he can still hit targets with precision accuracy - now he can just hit multiple targets at once even when surrounded.</p>
                        <p>Though this is not the only advantage to this style; he also uses his demonic power to directly change the very constitution of a weapon, reinforcing and reconfiguring his arsenal to points near-impossibility: a prime example is
                            him using a revolver and firing all six shots at once like a shotgun. This prevents him from using normal weapons anymore - however, he has a large enough catalog of custom-made weaponry to avoid that issue.</p>

                    <article id="sub-tab-03">
                        <strong>Swordmaster</strong>
                        <p>Dante is a master of the sword, swinging around claymores like they were daggers - Swordmaster, however, makes even professional fencers lose all sense of self-confidence and esteem. He is able to move like he has eyes in the back
                            of his head, striking enemies from behind with the same effort used to swat at a fly before going right back into slicing and dicing with precision and accuracy without missing a beat. He also possesses something of a telekinetic
                            heft on whatever weapon he uses, combining his command of power with actual telekinesis to call weapons to him even from great distances.</p>
                        <p>He can channel his energy through Devil Arms to unlock more of their elemental affinities, bringing about an entirely new game to a fight to hit demons where it hurts most. His sense of control also reflects through the way he
                            uses his weapons, throwing out elemental wrath in the same breaths as actually attacking.</p>
                    </article>

                    <article id="sub-tab-04">
                        <strong>Royal Guard</strong>
                        <p>Dante makes a conscious effort to let his energy exude centimeters from him before regulating the resulting barrier to a passive state - from then on, he is protected further from damage with his Royalguard style. The energy is
                            somewhat meager in comparison to what he can output, but compensates by focusing all energy into the points of impact. However, once he focuses his attention on blocking any particular method of blocking he puts out even more
                            energy to completely nullify anything that comes his way. The more punishment dealt to him in either case, the more that kinetic energy is stored within the barrier and the more punishment Dante can take.</p>
                        <p>From that point he can either take that energy and expel it with massive amounts of force back towards his assailant, heavily weakining their own defenses, or use it to form a demonic exoskeleton that, while it limits his movement,
                            is nigh impregnable.</p>
                    </article>

                    <article id="sub-tab-05">
                        <strong>Quicksilver</strong>
                        <p>A style that actually requires a bit more effort on Dante’s end to utilize - but it is instantly made up for with the mere fact that it is a temporal alteration combat state. Quicksilver allows him to use the inherent ‘strangeness’
                            of his demonic heritage in tandem with his own vast power to create particles that emit time-slowing fields, before releasing it all at once either through a radial burst or a more focused flash-burst. Both slow the areas of
                            effect to a crawl to the point where a high-caliber bullet moves about as fast as a snail, though the focus burst slows the adversary down further still.</p>
                        <p>As a passive effect of even possessing this style, Dante is immune to to similar temporal powers even down to the point of paradoxes occuring. His body will change according to what occurs in his timeline to change it, but his
                            constituent parts as well as his powers and abilities remain the same; Devil Trigger bypasses all this outright, allowing him to retain his original devil body regardless of paradoxes.</p>
                    </article>

                    <article id="sub-tab-06">
                        <strong>Doppelganger</strong>
                        <p>Dante has come a startlingly long way with this style, originally a mere supplement to his past skill now effectively his own personal knight. His thoughts are linked perfectly with the subordinate Doppelganger, which resides within
                            a personal pocket of the demon realm linked to Dante and manifests through his shadow - as a result it obeys his every mental command as soon as it comes, whether it be through following his actions or attacking independent
                            of his own physical actions to overwhelm an adversary. Its shadowy mass is a peculiarity: while it can strike every bit as hard as Dante himself, it has far less physical resilience - however, this is made up with through the
                            fact that it is much more malleable, able to keep attacking at optimal speeds even when there are weapons lodged inside of it that would serve as a hindrance even to Dante.</p>
                        <p>His shadow is not the limits of his ability to summon the doppelganger; if he was in complete darkness, he could summon multiples of the creatures to assist him.</p>

                                <p>Twin handguns that Dante's been using since he was a teenager, customized for him by the late Nell Goldstein. Because they were the only other weapons present on him apart from Rebellion during his 'awakening', they
                                    are linked to him as closely as the claymore is - as such, each shot can easily carry the power of an elephant gun without the danger of the tremendous recoil.</p>

                                    on long-ranged suppression while Ivory boasts phenomenal rapid-fire capability. The weapons are capable of killing even massive demons with ease through the sheer amount of kinetic energy each bullet can generate, and
                                    when fired parallel to one another unleashes a spiral shot powerful enough to blow a tank apart.</p>

                                <p>How a military weapon found its way so deep within Temen-ni-gru is a feat Dante always attested to the inherent willpower of humanity. A modified Lahti L-39, the Spiral features a shortened barrel, a wood handguard replacing
                                    the standard bipod, and a carry handle in front of the magazine housing. Likely modifications made by its previous owner to better combat the hellspawns within the tower without sacrificing mobility as much as otherwise.</p>
                                    <p>When Dante triggers his Gunslinger style, each round fired becomes shrouded in demon energy that allows it to ricochet off of surfaces in way it shouldn't otherwise.
                                      This is due to the energy surrounding it carrying both a bouncy and explosive property that accelerates the bullet every time it comes in contact with a surface.</p>

                                The weapon fires condensed, reboundable orbs of demon energy at its lowest setting, and the more energy is pumped into it the more shots it can fire at once similarly to Artemis.</p>
                                <p>However, with Gunslinger Dante can actually transform the weapon into a close replica of its original counterpart, granting him use of a penetrating laser strike and several satellite orbs that function as turrets that siphon particles from the air for their projectiles.</p>

It has a laser targeting system built in and iron sights since its recoil is actually much lower than most shotguns, and is outfitted to both use a magazine and reload rounds individually.</p>
                                <p>The gun uses cold iron slugs as its ammunition, which is a major deterrent to demonkind - in the case of lower-level or energy-based devils, it is fatal. 'Cold iron' is a specific type of iron forged through purely physical means; if it is modified through heat or electricity or chemicals, it loses the specific properties that makes it so dangerous against demons.
                                Untampered iron introduced into a demon's body acts like water on an electric current: it diverts the infernal essence into places it shouldn't, on top of nullifying that very same essence soon after. The slugs themselves make it so that Gunslinger actually does NOT work on the Dead Ringer lest he completely break the gun.</p>

The revolver utilizes 'Crusader' ammunition: cross-tipped silver bullets crafted for use in .44 magnum casing,
which is surprisingly effective even in this day and age of full-on demon hunting.
The interior of the barrel has various runes enscribed into it that was meant for 'holy' enchantments,
but is indiscriminant for any kind of energy that is used for it -
as such, Dante can use the weapon's magical augmentation without the same worry as with his Dead Ringer.</p>

                        <p>Originally it was a keepsake from his father - now it is his own personal weapon, bound to the very essence that defines Dante as He. It is a literal extension of himself, and thus he can summon it at any time and from any location,
                            eliminating the need to hide it from public eye through external methods.</p>
                        <p>Similarly, because of this unbreakable bond and extension of the self, Rebellion is perfectly adept at releasing his true power without a bit of effort on Dante’s end; former moves such as Drive are Round Trip are trivialized to
                            simple swipes of the weapon. Outside of his hands, it is a claymore that is impossible to lift from the ground let alone use, even by those that share his blood.</p>
                        <p>As it is an extension of his very soul, he can manifest the blade into an indestructible humanoid form that takes the appearance of a <a style="color: white; text-decoration: none" href="http://profiles.rphaven.com/The%20Legendary%20Devil%20Bane"
