        <section>
          <p>Dante has awakened his true demonic self decades ago, and now he is only a half-breed through circumstance of birth; for all intents and purposes otherwise, he is a full-blooded devil. As a result there is little difference in his power in terms of both strength and speed - it is all entirely based upon the physical state of each - and he can remain in this form indefinitely.
            His telekinetic heft on his weaponry is near-absolute with the direct access to his power.</p>
          <p>In his devil form he can withstand far more punishment without taking damage at all. His skin replaced with a durable, bulletproof carapace, and while his flesh is slightly more exposed as a result of the joints within the key areas of his unnatural protection, is stronger overall because of the complete unlock of energy output; he constantly exudes demonic energy with no effort on his end, and this extends through to his styles and their usages of his energy.
            Trickster style has him right on the barrier of the human realm and the shadow realm, Gunslinger and Swordmaster constantly siphons energy through to the respective weapons, Royalguard’s limitations on the demon armor are removed entirely as his carapace is already a natural armor, Quicksilver style is automatically triggered when he is in top shape, Doppelganger style has the greatest augment however, in which the shadowy doppelganger becomes a perfect replica of his demon state and can use the same projectile-based attacks that he can.</p>
          <p>Most important of all is the addition of wings, which allows him to fly. With the constant exuding of energy he can levitate for as long as he remains in his Triggered state, and can even perform wing-based attacks without the use of a Devil Arm.

            <strong>Trickster</strong>
            <p>A combat style that allows Dante to dance, dash, and disappear all along the battleground as untouchable as a phantom. Counter-maneuvers are regulated effectively towards instinct, using his vast array of experience for the few moments where he isn’t prepared for something - though for the most part, this is hardly triggered. Dante’s mind is plenty complex enough to receive and interpret information from his senses near instantly, giving him plenty of time to react accordingly.</p>
            <p>With this style he can perform pseudo-teleports over short distances, granting him the advantage of getting the drop on an enemy even within the very midsts of intense close quarters combat, and in combination with the array of powers granted by utilizing the less stringent laws of physics granted by having a shadow copy he can dodge attacks entirely even if that same attack already hit him. In such an instance he simply shoves himself aside by near-instantaneously replacing his own being with that of shadow mass, the force that comes from such a replacement serving to propel him away from the direction of the attack.</p>
          </article>
          <article id="sub-tab-02">
            <strong>Gunslinger</strong>
            <p>Perhaps one of the only styles that maintains the original flair he used to possess. Gunslinger style allows him to turn simple aiming and shooting to a veritable circus act, throwing and flinging his weapons around in perfect gunkatas. Even with the constant movement of his weaponry he can still hit targets with precision accuracy - now he can just hit multiple targets at once even when surrounded.</p>
            <p>Though this is not the only advantage to this style; he also uses his demonic power to directly modify the very constitution of a weapon, reinforcing and reconfiguring his arsenal to points where it should be borderline physically impossible to do certain things: a prime example is him using a revolver and firing all six shots at once like a shotgun. This prevents him from using normal weapons anymore - however, he has a large enough catalog of custom-made weaponry to avoid that issue.</p>
          </article>

          <article id="sub-tab-03">
            <strong>Swordmaster</strong>
            <p>Dante is a master of the sword, swinging around claymores like they were daggers - Swordmaster, however, makes even professional fencers lose all sense of self-confidence and esteem. He is able to move like he has eyes in the back of his head, striking enemies from behind with the same effort used to swat at a fly before going right back into slicing and dicing with precision and accuracy without missing a beat. He also possesses something of a telekinetic heft on whatever weapon he uses, combining his command of power with actual telekinesis to call weapons to him even from great distances.</p>
            <p>He can channel his energy through Devil Arms to unlock more of their elemental affinities, bringing about an entirely new game to a fight to hit demons where it hurts more. His sense of control also reflects through the way he uses his weapons, throwing out elemental wrath in the same breaths as actually attacking.</p>
          </article>

          <article id="sub-tab-04">
            <strong>Royal Guard</strong>
            <p>Dante makes a conscious effort to let his energy exude centimeters from him before regulating the resulting barrier to a passive state - from then on, he is protected further from damage with his Royalguard style. The energy is somewhat meager in comparison to what he can output, but compensates by focusing all energy into the points of impact. However, once he focuses his attention on blocking any particular method of blocking he puts out even more energy to completely nullify anything that comes his way. The more punishment dealt to him in either case, the more that kinetic energy is stored within the barrier and the more punishment Dante can take.</p>
            <p>From that point he can either take that energy and expel it with massive amounts of force back towards his assailant, heavily weakining their own defenses, or use it to form an demon exoskeleton that, while it limits his movement, is nigh impregnable.</p>
          </article>

          <article id="sub-tab-05">
            <strong>Quicksilver</strong>
            <p>A style that actually requires a bit more effort on Dante’s end to utilize - but it is instantly made up for with the mere fact that it is a temporal alteration combat state. Quicksilver allows him to use the inherent ‘strangeness’ of his demonic heritage in tandem with his own vast power to create particles that emit time-slowing fields, before releasing it all at once either through a radial burst or a more focused flash-burst. Both slow the areas of effect to a crawl to the point where a high-caliber bullet moves about as fast as a snail, though the focus burst slows the adversary down further still.</p>
            <p>As a passive effect of even possessing this style, Dante is immune to to similar temporal powers even down to the point of paradoxes occuring. His body will change according to what occurs in his timeline to change it, but his constituent parts as well as his powers and abilities remain the same; Devil Trigger bypasses all this outright, allowing him to retain his original devil body regardless of paradoxes.</p>
          </article>

          <article id="sub-tab-06">
            <strong>Doppelganger</strong>
            <p>Dante has come a startlingly long way with this style, originally a mere supplement to his past skill now effectively his own personal knight. His thoughts are linked perfectly with the subordinate Doppelganger, which resides within a personal pocket of the demon realm linked to Dante and manifests through his shadow - as a result it obeys his every mental command as soon as it comes, whether it be through following his actions or attacking independent of his own physical actions to overwhelm an adversary. Its shadowy mass is a peculiarity: while it can strike every bit as hard as Dante himself, it has far less physical resilience - however, this is made up with through the fact that it is much more malleable, able to keep attacking at optimal speeds even when there are weapons lodged inside of it that would serve as a hindrance even to Dante.</p>
            <p>His shadow is not the limits of his ability to summon the doppelganger; if he was in complete darkness, he could summon multiples of the creatures to assist him.</p>

                <p>Twin handguns that Dante's been using since he was a teenager, customized for use exclusively for him by the late Nell Goldstein. Because they were the only other weapons present on him apart from Rebellion during his Final Awakening, they are linked to him as closely as the claymore is - as such, each shot can easily carry the power of an elephant gun without the danger of the tremendous recoil. When used for their specific functions, Ebony has the claim on long-ranged suppression while Ivory boasts phenomenal rapid-fire capability.</p>

                <p>Obtained during the start of his career in Temen-ni-gru, as a by-product of opening a path that obstructed him. The weapon seems to have a semi-intelligence of its own that allows it to direct the arrow-like blasts wherever it is required prior to fully exiting the barrel. It can either fire a single shot at its lowest setting, a volley of varying quantities, or a single close-range sphere that detonates violently on contact as a close-range option.</p>

A modified Lahti L-39, the Spiral features a shortened barrel, a wood handguard replacing the standard bipod, and a carry handle in front of the magazine housing. Likely modifications made by its previous owner to better combat the hellspawns within the tower without sacrificing mobility as much as otherwise.</p>

            <strong>Rebellion</strong>
            <em>The Legendary Devil Bane</em>
            <p>Originally it was a keepsake from his father - now it is his own personal weapon, bound to the very essence that defines Dante as He. It is a literal extension of himself, and thus he can summon it at any time and from any location, eliminating the need to hide it from public eye through external methods.</p>
            <p>Similarly, because of this unbreakable bond and extension of the self, Rebellion is perfectly adept at releasing his true power without a bit of effort on Dante’s end; former moves such as Drive are Round Trip are trivialized to simple swipes of the weapon. Outside of his hands, it is a claymore that is impossible to lift from the ground let alone use, even by those that share his blood.</p>
            <p>As it is an extension of his very soul, he can manifest the blade into an indestructible humanoid form that takes the appearance of a white-haired woman. So long as Dante lives, it will remain in whatever state he directs.</p>

            <strong>Cerberus</strong>
            <em>The Ice Guardian</em>
            <p>A tripartite nunchaku chiseled from the soul of Temen-ni-gru’s ice guardian. The chains that keep the weapon together can unlock from one another and extend to any length its user chooses, all connected by the very bond that keeps a soul together. Its power is as icy cold as the guardian it was taken from, capable of generating endless amounts of subzero frost and siphoning the heat of molten rock in seconds.</p>
            <p>
Those incapable of taming this beast suffer a never-ending torment of chill, frozen for all eternity by the very power the sought and failed to control. Release is greatly lusted after, but the bite of Cerberus keeps all fire from saving them.</p>

            <strong>Agni &amp; Rudra</strong>
            <em>The Firestorm</em>
            <p>Twin serrated scimitar comprised of the minds of two cordial gatekeepers; the Fire is appropriately hued, as is the Storm. Separately they are mere weapons of intense fire and cutting winds, but together they are the Firestorm: the relentless rending of flesh, scorching of wound, and reopening of old wounds never to see an end. </p>
            <p>The unworthy fall victim to the maelstrom of evisceration; those unfortunate enough not to be torn to nothingness by the Firestorm are enslaved by the demon blades to serve as a host body, their souls never seeing salvation for the rest of its days... And they also don't shut up.</p>

            <strong>Nevan</strong>
            <em>The Sorceress of the Abyss</em>
            <p>The chordophone birthed from the very womb of the Lightning Witch, the sorceress of The Abyss, the Opera’s Songstress. Its seductive tones lure the weak into the guillotine of its embrace, granting the victim one last jolt of ecstasy before their demise. For the distant they are accosted with the liberating bite of her wicked angels, sucked dry of their vital essence and leaving little more than a carcass unfit for even a vulture to feed upon.</p>
            <p>Suffice it to say, those incapable of satisfying this succubus of a witch become one of these very victims.</p>

            <strong>Beowulf</strong>
            <em>The Lightbeast</em>
            <p>Fashioned from the limbs of the Lightbeast and fueled by his insurmountable rage, these armaments of gauntlet and greave grant its wielder the capacity of a ‘blink bruiser’ - a brawler that can flash from enemy to enemy with all the power of one beset with Wrath. A luminescence that burns deeper than flesh, reaches further than the naked eye, and strikes wholly with the mass of a steel volley, it is a weapon befitting of a true master.</p>
            <p>As for those finding themselves overcome with the blinding desire for revenge in this soul, they are doomed to follow in the footsteps of this Lightbeast, to fight and maim and kill until there is nothing left for them to fight with.</p>

            <strong>Alastor</strong>
            <em>The Spirit of Lightning</em>
            <p>A blade with both spirit and mind still intact and functional; only those worthy of it can take control of its power over the roar of the sky, the fang of the darkcast: lightning. As befitting its heft on lightning it grants the user the ability to tap into their reflexive strength and hone it into a proper weapon, striking quickly and many before their foes have a chance to blink. It also powers one’s hidden potential, allowing them to bring it out in full and become a knight of the sky.</p>
            <p>All others will be enslaved by its will, becoming little more than a vessel for its power; the soul itself is amplified to feel every last bit of electricity coursing through its being, doomed to suffer until the end of its usefulness.</p>

            <strong>Ifrit</strong>
            <em>The Gauntlet of Flame</em>
            <p>The explosive burn of these fists are those of the hellfire serpent, the Dragon of the Dark. Its control of hellfire is a sight to behold, able to melt and destroy all things foolish enough to stand against it. While its power destroys those it is used against, the dragon’s master remains forever unharmed and uninhibited; it is but an extension of their own prowess.</p>
            <p>But there is a test its master must pass, and if they fail they are shackled by the gauntlets themselves and burned until it is but a cast of hot coal.</p>

            <strong>Sparda</strong>
            <em>The Legendary Dark Knight</em>
            <p>Long sought after by demon and human alike, and finally in the possession of the one most qualified: the last son of the blade’s master himself. It has the uncanny ability to morph soul and form to suit its owner’s needs of combat; a scythe, spear, sword and shield are but a few of the forms it can take. As its history has seen numerous wielders until this point, Dante has made himself the ‘guardian’ of this weapon to ensure it cannot be used for evil again.</p>
            <p>To ensure this, he has ripped his half of the amulet back out from the weapon to render its power dormant; Dante himself is now its guardian.</p>

            <strong>Gilgamesh</strong>
            <em>The Shock Steel</em>
            <p>Forged of a metal found only within the demon world, which is also said to have been the by-product of an ancient hero’s very flesh. This weapon set aligns itself with the nervous system of the user, sharpening their perception to where they can turn their brutal blows into succinct slices. The more flesh is torn asunder, the more that matter is absorbed into it to strengthen density and raw energy.</p>
            <p>Of course this is as double-edged a blade as one can find. This is a weapon that lures in many with a seemingly safe source of power, but the more this weapon is used by those incapable of sustaining it, the more their own flesh is used to feed it.</p>

            <strong>Pandora</strong>
            <em>The Calamitous Ordnance</em>
            <p>The legend of the foolish woman that opened the box of omen is anything but, and the box was housed in the ‘safety’ of Hell so as to keep other humans from making the same mistake. The box can form into 666 different weapons and is powered by the chaos each unleashes; there is not a being in the universe that can fuel the metaphysical evils of the world, not even its current owner. Unless the user intends to spread mass destruction and mayhem, this is a very 'special circumstance' weapon.</p>
            <p>Should one be careless and choose to use the 666th form without closing it back immediately...</p>

            <strong>Lucifer</strong>
            <em>The Inexhaustible Sword</em>
            <p>From the weapon whose namesake hails from the devil of Pride comes an unending cache of penetrating blades. All but its user are pierced by this weapon’s darts, and upon command will detonate and explode with tremendous force. As it is a weapon tethered to the mental direction of its user they can trail behind them, appear within an instant around the intended target, and when detonated at once will chain into a devastating explosion.</p>
            <p>
The weak of mind will succumb to the influence of this weapon, driven mad and attacking everyone and everything in sight with no control over their own blades.</p>

            <strong>Vendetta</strong>
            <em>The HEAT Striker</em>
            <p>The first success in a long line of artificial devil weaponry. Dante possesses the prototype of the Vendetta ICWS, and is able to channel his power through spatial compressors that bypass normal physical properties to destroy any type of protective materials. The blades upon the gloves and boots serve as a rail system in an A.P.P. (accelerated particle projector) system, adding lethal long-range capability to an already vicious CQC capacity.</p>
            <p>Dante in particular has displayed the ability to channel massive amounts of power through the regulated charging system and release it in a sustained blast that rips through anything in his path.</p>

            <strong>Merciless</strong>
            <em>The Soul Reaver</em>
            <p>A key component in a dynamo system created to siphon and regulate the power of Argosax, Merciless is a glaive weapon made out of tungsten and fused together with base devil essence, locked onto a device locked onto his hand. It has become a weapon capable of directly stealing the energy from a living being and converting it into energy required by whatever system it is connected to - in this case, replenishing Dante’s expended devil energy.</p>
            <p>Dante also uses it as a tether whenever it becomes lodged into something, warping himself to the weapon and proceeding to wrench it out of the object - or person, or demon - with enough force to tear out a good chunk of it - or simply tear it apart.</p>
